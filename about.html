        <h1>About Us</h1>

        <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
        <p><strong>Colossians 3:12-14</strong><br>
        Therefore, as God's chosen people, holy and dearly loved, clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, patience, and love.</p>

        <h2>Greatest Commandment</h2>
        <p>To love the Lord thy God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, with all your strength and to love your neighbor as yourself.</p>

        <h2>What the Church Is and What We Believe</h2>
        <p>We are a Full Gospel church that believes in all the offices: Apostle, Prophet, Pastor, Teacher, Evangelist.<br>
        We believe in all the gifts of the Spirit and operate in them.<br>
        We are a very strong prophetic church.<br>
        We believe the Lord is coming for a pure church.<br>
        We believe He desires to run the church, not man.<br>
        We believe that a person needs to be born again and have a desire for a surrendered life in Jesus.<br>
        We believe that Jesus is our salvation and the only way to have eternal life.<br>
        We believe that Jesus is the Messiah and gave His life on the cross for usâ€”the final sacrifice for our sins.<br>
        We believe He rose again on the third day, then ascended into heaven, and will come again.<br>
        We are a church that believes worship is powerful and ushers us into the presence of the Lord.<br>
        As the Lord shared with us: <em>"Worship is for Me and My Word is for you."</em></p>

        <h2>Church Goal</h2>
        <p>To see the lost saved.<br>
        Encourage believers to have a desire to go deeper into their relationship with Christ.<br>
        All believers to come to know the voice of the Lord.<br>
        For believers to operate in their natural and God-ordained gifts.</p>
